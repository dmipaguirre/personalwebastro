  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello, I’m Miguel Páez, a technology enthusiast. This blog was born with the
    intention of sharing my thoughts, ideas, and especially my personal
    experiences: life events, comments, and reflections of all kinds. I’m here,
    after much procrastination, frustrations and failed attempts, diving into
    what has been, so far, my unfulfilled dream: becoming a programmer. My posts
    are casual and straightforward, but I always try to offer a personal
    perspective (maybe not the absolute truth, but an honest one) on the topics
    that interest me. I like to keep a friendly and approachable tone, because I
    firmly believe that knowledge and fun can go hand in hand.
